		<p>this is my digital Physics Lab. It wraps practically all the functionality of the <a href="http://chipmunk-physics.net/">Chipmunk physics lib</a> into a handy GUI for testing and prototyping games and other programs.</p>

		<p>The use-case I had in mind is that of a developer looking to make something with Chipmunk, but, of course it serves as a nice toy, or physics sandbox as well. Part of the challenge of building things with Chipmunk is finding ranges of values (Gravity, densities, dimensions,  elasticity, impulses, etc...) that play well with each other.The other part is fine-tuning your geometry. There are always tiny little snags and collisions messing up your sim.</p>
		<p>The GUI hopefully is a powerful tool for combating both of these issues.</p>
		<p>It loads and exports .svg, and also exports C code to even further accelerate the development process!</p>

		<p>You can get it for 5 USD at <a href="https://introscopia.itch.io/introscopias-physics-lab">Itch.io</a>, or just email me and ask me nicely idk ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</p>
